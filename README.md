## 0.1 Installing Python 3
This project requires a Python 3 installation with the numpy and matplotlib packages. On Ubuntu Linux, download python by using:

```sudo apt install python3 python3-numpy python3-matplotlib```

On Mac OS X, download Anaconda 2019.03 with Python 3.7 from https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section and follow the installer. You can verify your installation by
using:

```python3 --version```

It may be necessary to use "pythonw" instead depending on the particular version of Mac OS X.
On Windows, download Anaconda 2019.03 with Python 3.7 from https://www.anaconda.com/
distribution/#download-section.
On Ubuntu Linux and Mac OS X, use python3 to run python. On Windows, use python instead.
You can use a plain text editor for the project. If you would like to use an IDE, we recommend that
you download PyCharm from https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/. The free community edition
succesfully, but you can get the professional edition for free as well, see https://www.jetbrains.
com/student/ for details.
